# 🧠 AI Notes API — Developer Documentation Project

A fictional **AI-powered Notes REST API** created to demonstrate professional **API documentation design**, **OpenAPI specification**, and **modern static site publishing** using **Nextra**, **Postman**, and **Vercel**.

This project is part of a personal portfolio built by [Santiago Bolívar](https://santiagobolivar.dev), Senior Technical Writer at Uber, to showcase expertise in API documentation workflows and developer education.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **AI Notes API** simulates a RESTful service for creating and managing notes, enhanced by AI features such as text summarization, keyword extraction, and automatic title generation.

All endpoints and responses are **mocked using Postman**, and the documentation is written in **MDX** with **Nextra** for a clean, developer-friendly browsing experience.

This project mirrors the structure and quality of enterprise-level developer portals.
