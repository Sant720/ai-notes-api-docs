# API documentation for AI Notes app

Welcome to the **AI Notes API Documentation** — a portfolio project by [Santiago Bolivar](https://santiagobolivar.dev) designed to simulate **real-world, developer-facing documentation** for a RESTful API.  

This project demonstrates a complete documentation workflow: from planning and simulation, to OpenAPI specification and publication using modern tooling (Postman, Nextra, GitHub, Vercel).

## Project Overview

The **AI Notes API** is a fictional REST API for an AI-enhanced note-taking service.  
It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete notes, as well as AI-powered actions such as:

- **Summarizing** notes automatically  
- **Extracting keywords** for tagging and organization  
- **Generating smart titles** using generative AI

This documentation mirrors what you would expect from a production-ready internal developer portal — including clear examples, error codes, and machine-readable specs.

## Purpose & Learning Goals

This project was created to:

- **Showcase API documentation skills** — structure, clarity, and developer empathy.  
- **Demonstrate AI literacy** — integrate realistic GenAI endpoints and usage.  
- **Model enterprise-level documentation systems** using a stack similar to what’s used at large-scale tech organizations.  
- **Provide recruiters and hiring managers** with a tangible example of how I approach information architecture, content modeling, and technical storytelling.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Postman** | API design, examples, and mock server |
| **Nextra (Next.js)** | Static site generator for docs |
| **OpenAPI 3.0** | Machine-readable API spec |
| **GitHub + Vercel** | Source control and deployment |
| **Markdown/MDX** | Authoring format for content |

## Documentation Sections

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Getting Started** | Authentication, setup, and first call |
| **Endpoints** | CRUD and AI-powered endpoints |
| **Examples** | Sample requests with curl and Python |
| **Errors** | Common responses and troubleshooting |
| **Changelog** | Simulated version history |

> This project is **not connected to a live backend** — all endpoints are simulated through Postman mocks and an OpenAPI spec to emulate a realistic developer experience.
