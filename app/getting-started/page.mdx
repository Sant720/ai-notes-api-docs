# Getting started

This guide will help you get up and running with the **AI Notes API** mock environment.  
Even though this is a simulated API, the structure, authentication, and examples model real-world API design principles.


## Before you begin

You’ll need:

- A REST client such as **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or **curl**
- Access to the **mock server URL** (placeholder below)
- Basic familiarity with JSON and HTTP request methods


## Authentication

The AI Notes API uses a simple **API key** scheme to simulate secure access.

| Header | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <API_KEY>` | `Bearer demo-123456789` |

Include your key in the `Authorization` header on every request.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.mockserver.io/v1/notes   -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-123456789"
```

> This is a simulated key for documentation purposes only. In a real production API, keys would be issued and managed via a developer portal.


## Base URL

All API requests use the same base URL (mocked via Postman):

```
https://api.mockserver.io/v1
```

Example endpoints:

| Action | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| List all notes | `GET /notes` |
| Get a note | `GET /notes/{id}` |
| Create a note | `POST /notes` |
| Summarize a note | `POST /notes/{id}/summarize` |

## Make your first request

Retrieve a list of notes:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.mockserver.io/v1/notes   -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-123456789"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Sample response:

```json
{
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": "note_123",
      "title": "Meeting notes: AI design review",
      "content": "Discussed model fine-tuning and summarization endpoints.",
      "created_at": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

## What’s next

- Visit **Endpoints** for CRUD and AI actions.
- Read **Errors** for common responses and troubleshooting.
- Check the **OpenAPI spec** for schemas (`/openapi.yaml`).

> 🔗 Tip: When available, use the Postman “Run in Postman” button from this page to import the collection and try requests quickly.
